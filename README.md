# SJF Algorithm Visualization in React

A web-based tool to visualize the **Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm**, built using **React**. This interactive application allows users to input processes, burst times, and priority levels to understand how the SJF algorithm works.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive UI:** Add, modify, and delete processes dynamically.
- **SJF Non-Preemptive Logic:** Visualize how the algorithm schedules processes.
- **Result Display:** Shows waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Instant calculation of the average waiting time.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Styling:** CSS / Tailwind (optional customization)  
- **State Management:** React Hooks

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Parth-12pm/SJF-Algorithm-React-.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SJF-Algorithm-React-

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

**📊 How It Works**
- Input processes with burst times and arrival times.
- The app sorts processes according to burst time.
- Results include average waiting and turnaround times displayed on the interface.

**🐛 Known Issues**
- No preemptive SJF mode currently supported.
- UI improvements are under development.
